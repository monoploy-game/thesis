\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
        The classic board game Monopoly has been enjoyed by millions of people of all ages for over eight decades. It is a game that involves buying, selling, and trading properties with the objective of becoming the wealthiest
player.
        Monopoly has brought joy to countless families and friends over the years. However, the game's reliance on paper money and too many physical game pieces can make it cumbersome and time-consuming to play. 
        This thesis presents an app designed to streamline gameplay by providing a digital system for managing players' money and properties.

         The app is designed to reduce the amount of paper used during gameplay and make it less time-consuming, while still maintaining the social and fun aspects of playing the game in person.
        The app includes features such as digital money management, property management, game tracking, customizable rules, and multiplayer support. 
        These features aim to simplify the gameplay experience for players while also enhancing it by providing real-time updates, detailed statistics, and customizable options. The thesis will evaluate the effectiveness of the app in improving the Monopoly gameplay experience, with a focus on how it impacts gameplay mechanics, player interaction, and overall enjoyment.
        It is important to note that while the app is designed to reduce the amount of paper used and make gameplay more efficient, it is not intended to replace the physical presence of the players and the board game itself. The fun and social aspects of playing Monopoly in person are an essential part of the game's appeal, and the app is designed to complement and enhance these aspects, rather than replace them.
        Overall, the final goal of the app is to provide a digital solution that makes playing Monopoly more convenient and efficient, while still preserving the fun and social elements of the game that make it a beloved classic.
        The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness of the app in improving the Monopoly gameplay experience, as well as to identify areas for potential future development. 
        The thesis will begin by reviewing the literature on board games and digital technology, as well as discussing the design and development process of the app. Next, the thesis will present the results of user testing and surveys to evaluate the app's usability and user experience. Finally, the thesis will conclude with a discussion of the findings and potential directions for future research in this area.


\section{Problematic}\label{sec:prbm}
